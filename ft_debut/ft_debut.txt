1. In the most concise way possible, answer this question, what is 42? How would you
describe 42 to someone who doesn’t know what 42 is?

42 is a tuition free school which breaks the commonly accepted constructs of how learning occurs. It instead creates an environment of learning through self-motivated individual problem solving as well as peer to peer instruction.

2. Why are there no instructions on the initial 42 logic tests?

Similar to a workplace environment, I feel that most challenges or problems don't come with a specific set of instructions on how to create a solution. Instead one must be able to determine factors that will lead to a solution either through collaborating with peers or by developing that solution..

3. What are the core 42 principles?

I feel that 42's core principles are peer learning, adaptability particularly when handling failure, and overall tenacity and resiliency. 

4. If somebody is thinking of going to 42, but has no coding experience - do you really
think it’s worth their time?

From just my experience at the piscine, as someone who had no previous coding experience I feel like I learned many important life skills that are not exclusive to coding. It is definitely easier to have some previous coding experience, but whether you pass a piscine or not, there are always things to learn and skills to practice which can be utilized throughout the rest of your life (or the next piscine).

5. What makes 42 unique?

Not tuition. No teachers. The way that the learning is done. Just how friendly and willing people are to help and teach one another no matter the situation.

6. What do you think you’re learning the most at 42?

Learning how to fail. To be okay with it. And then to move on and learn from that failure to apply to the next situation.

7. Imagine (this will happen very soon in real life!), you’ve been stuck on the problem
for a while and have no idea what to do - what your next steps would be?

Google, Manual, asking the peer to my left and right. I think asking someone who has experience in that area for tips on how they approached a problem or if there was any direction that could be imparted; is one of the best ways to become unstuck.

8. How will you ensure that your personal level of motivation remains high on a daily
basis to complete at least 1 level per month without the Piscine pressure and strict deadlines?

I would like to think I have the personal motivation to see this all the way through. But I know that is not true. I'm counting on others helping to keep me motivated just as I hope to be able to motivate others when needed.

9. If someone asks you why it says internships are required on the 42 website, but they
do not offer job placement, what would you say?

I feel like the purpose of 42 is not to create programmers to immediately come out and find a job in 4 months like some bootcamps. Instead it looks to sharpen the skillset of the individual. Internships, whether they offer job placement or not, offer that real world work environment to learn in.

10. How do the internships work? Is it mandatory that you have to reach a certain level
before leaving on an internship or can you validate it anytime you find one?

One can in theory look for an internship at any time on their own, but in order to be validated for an internship, one must first reach Level 7.

11. How does 42 help you adapt to a work place?

I think the skills of problem solving, learning from failure, and working with peers are all things that are taught at 42 and are vital in a workplace.
